medium,collegelife,Writing Workshop,I don't think my attention span is more than 5 minutes.
medium,collegelife,Writing Workshop,"Don't worry, I'll pinch you to wake you up."
medium,collegelife,Writing Workshop,That's a clever idea.
medium,collegelife,Studying Abroad,I'm planning to study abroad this summer.

medium,collegelife,Studying Abroad,"I will, and I'll study hard, too."
medium,collegelife,Studying Abroad,"Also, learn some Italian while you're there."

medium,collegelife,Job Fair,What is your major?
medium,collegelife,Job Fair,My major is geology.
medium,collegelife,Job Fair,"Geology majors aren't very high in demand, but you'll do fine."
medium,collegelife,Job Fair,What makes you say that?
medium,collegelife,Job Fair,You're smart and likeable. Don't worry.
medium,collegelife,Job Fair,"Thanks, but I'm still scared."

medium,collegelife,Job Fair,Yes. Take advantage of it.
medium,collegelife,Job Fair,Have you ever been there?
medium,collegelife,Job Fair,"Yes, and it's really helpful. Dress nicely!"
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,I am so sick of dining hall food.
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,Me too! It's so unhealthy.
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,We should go to a restaurant nearby.
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,Want to go to Health Nut?
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,What a funny name!
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,I like it!
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,Do they sell nuts?
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,"I'm not sure. Anyways, I want to try their organic tofu."
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,I'm allergic to tofu.
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,That's okay! They serve a wide variety of food.
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,Great! I'm just glad we're not eating dining hall food.
medium,collegelife,A Restaurant by the College,Me too. Let's go!
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,Why are you taking so long? Is something wrong?
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,"Sorry, my bag of chips got stuck."
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,"Vending machines suck, huh?"
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,"They're the worst, but the food is great."
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,It might come out if someone buys an item from the same column yours is on.
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,"Can you be that ""someone?"""
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,"Sure, why not? I could use some chips."
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,"Thanks! Hey, what is your name?"

medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,What is your name?
medium,collegelife,Vending Machine Problems,Hater of Vending Machines.
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,I would like to purchase the book for Sociology 130.
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,May I see your student ID?
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,I didn't know we needed it.
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,"Please go get your ID, and get in line again."
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,But I waited in line for two hours!
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,"I'm sorry, but you need a student ID to purchase textbooks here."
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,Are there any other options?
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,"Show me proof that you're a student at this college, and you'll be good."
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,I have my report card. Here it is.
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,This will do. Nice grades by the way.
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,Thanks! I worked very hard for them.
medium,collegelife,Forgetting Your Student ID,Good luck with this semester.
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,Wow! Your books are over the due date by one month.
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,It would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record.
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,What kind of hold is on your record?
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,A hold that won't let me go to the college football game.
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,"Oh, that's tough."
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,"Yeah. My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader, and so I have to go."
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,You're not going to like what I'm going to say.
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,What is it?
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,I can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,Is it a technical error?
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,I don't know! I just can't remove it!
medium,collegelife,The Overdue Hold,"If my girlfriend breaks up with me, I'm blaming you."
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,What do you plan to do after you graduate from here?
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,I'm planning to go to medical school. You?
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,I'm planning to teach English in underprivileged countries.
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,That's really kind of you.
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,Thanks. The first country I'm teaching in is Kenya.
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,"While you're at Kenya, I'll be studying for medical school."
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,What kind of doctor do you want to be?
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,I want to be a pediatrician.
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,Because you like kids?
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,I don't really have a good reason. I just think I'll be good at it.
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,"You should do what you love, not necessarily what you're good at."
medium,collegelife,Post-Undergraduate Plans,That is very cheesy advice.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,"The parking permit is $200 per semester, right?"
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,It's actually $300.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,Why?! That's ridiculous.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,It's because of the budget cuts.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,That's a terrible excuse.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,It's the truth.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,Give me something better than that.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,"Miss, if you don't want to pay, then don't."
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,This is so stressful.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,I advise writing a letter to the dean.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,I bet he'll just throw it away.
medium,collegelife,Purchasing a Parking Permit,You would be surprised.
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,Do you have a car on campus?
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,"No, because it's hard to find parking here."
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,How do you get to places then?
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,I walk or take the bus.
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,That's crazy! I could never do that.
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,You should. It's great for the environment.
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,That's true. What do you do for fun then?
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,There's a lot of stuff to do around campus.
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,I never realized.
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,You should do some exploring.
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,You convinced me. I won't bring my car this semester.
medium,collegelife,Parking Issue,We can walk to places together now!
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,"You know you can't park here, right?"
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Listen, I had to talk to my friend really quickly, and there was no parking spaces."
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,I'm a broke college student.
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,And I'm a broke police officer. Deal with it.
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,Can't you just let me off with a warning?
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,No way. I have to be firm with you.
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,I'll buy you a box of donuts.
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,You have got to be kidding me.
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,I thought all cops liked donuts.
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,That's a stereotype. You should really learn to be quiet.
medium,collegelife,Fighting a Parking Ticket,I'll stay quiet if you let me off with a warning.
medium,collegelife,Sports,I'm thinking of joining a sports club on campus.
medium,collegelife,Sports,You should! It takes away the stress of studying.
medium,collegelife,Sports,What sport do you play?
medium,collegelife,Sports,I actually play on our university's baseball team.
medium,collegelife,Sports,That's cool! You must be really good.
medium,collegelife,Sports,"Yeah, I have a baseball scholarship."
medium,collegelife,Sports,No wonder you're in such great shape!
medium,collegelife,Sports,You'll be in great shape too after joining a sports club.
medium,collegelife,Sports,I'm thinking of joining the tennis club.
medium,collegelife,Sports,I wouldn't if I were you. The members don't even play tennis.
medium,collegelife,Sports,What do they do then?
medium,collegelife,Sports,"They just talk about tennis. They never even touched a racket, though."
medium,collegelife,Clubs,College is so boring. All I do is go to class.
medium,collegelife,Clubs,You should join some clubs.
medium,collegelife,Clubs,Are you a part of any clubs?
medium,collegelife,Clubs,Yes! I am currently in the Animal Lovers Club and the Knitting Club.
medium,collegelife,Clubs,What do you do in the Animal Lovers Club?
medium,collegelife,Clubs,"We do a lot of things! Last week, we walked dogs."
medium,collegelife,Clubs,That sounds fun. What's the wildest animal you ever interacted with?
medium,collegelife,Clubs,I touched a dodo bird a couple weeks ago.
medium,collegelife,Clubs,Dodo birds are extinct.
medium,collegelife,Clubs,I'm just messing with you!
medium,collegelife,Clubs,"You're silly! Okay, I'll join the Animal Lovers Club."
medium,collegelife,Clubs,Great! We always welcome new members.
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,I have to go to bed early.
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,Why? The night is still young!
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,I have a class at 7 a.m.
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,That's tough! My earliest class is at 9 a.m.
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,That sounds amazing to me.
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,How do you stay awake in that class?
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,"Before I go to class, I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower."
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,Interesting routine. Does it work?
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,Kind of. It's better than not doing it at all.
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,Why are you taking that class?
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,"It's only offered once a year, so I have to take it now."
medium,collegelife,Early Morning Class,"I hope the class is interesting, at least."
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,I hate my roommate.
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong with her?
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,"A lot of things. First of all, she snores so loudly!"
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,That's not really her fault. What else?
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,She never takes a shower.
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,That's disgusting! You should tell her to take a shower.
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,I did! She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,Ouch! Did you try to get a new roommate?
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,"I tried, but I could not. No one was willing to switch."
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,I guess you can get a new room by yourself.
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,"I can't afford it. Ugh, I hate her so much."
medium,collegelife,A Bad Roommate,It's okay. The year will be over before you know it.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,Are you okay? You look really sad.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,I'm homesick. I feel so out of place here.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,But this college is so awesome.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,"I know, but I really miss home."
medium,collegelife,Homesick,How far do you live?
medium,collegelife,Homesick,Far. Let's just say I need an airplane to get there.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,It's almost winter break. Hang in there.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,I don't think I can handle it anymore.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,Try calling your friends and family from your hometown.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,I don't want them to worry about me.
medium,collegelife,Homesick,Just call them. Don't you want to stop feeling sad?
medium,collegelife,Homesick,"Okay, I'll call them now."
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,I was wondering if I could change my major from biology to political science.
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,Those majors are very different from each other.
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,"I know, but I hate biology. I can't see myself studying it anymore."
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,"You can change it, but you'll have to take more classes."
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,I don't mind. Political science is really interesting to me.
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,You would be graduating a year late.
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,"Oh, no. I have to think a little more about this then."
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,"I think you should change it, since you hate biology."
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,"Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry I am so indecisive."
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,A lot of people change majors. It's normal.
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,But not as late as I did. I hate that I'm graduating after all my friends.
medium,collegelife,Changing Majors,You're making the right choice.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,I have decided to drop out of college.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,You're making the worst decision of your life.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,I just don't get the point of college. It's just memorizing.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,What are you going to do then?
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,I'm going to get a job!
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,As what? A burger flipper?
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,Don't be mean. I'm going to be rich and successful when I'm older.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,It's almost impossible to be rich and successful without a college degree.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,Look at Steve Jobs! He dropped out of college.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,He's a rare case.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,Watch me prove you wrong.
medium,collegelife,Dropping Out,I'd like to see you try.
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,I gained so much weight because my college dining hall is all-you-can-eat.
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,"It's called the ""freshman 15."""
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,What is that exactly?
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,It's an expression to refer to the observation that many college freshmen gain weight.
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,"Oh, I see. I definitely got the freshman 15 then."
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,You should use your college's gym.
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,I never have time.
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,"Oh, please! You just have to make time."
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,I guess I should set an hour to work out.
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,That's the attitude I like to hear!
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,Did you gain any weight?
medium,collegelife,Freshman 15,"Yeah, I just wear big clothes to hide my fat."
medium,library,A Special Library,"Hi, I'm here to apply for a library card."
medium,library,A Special Library,Is this your first time applying for one?
medium,library,A Special Library,It's my first time applying for a card here.
medium,library,A Special Library,Do you have cards with any other libraries?
medium,library,A Special Library,"Yes, I have one with my college and one with my local library."
medium,library,A Special Library,What college do you go to?
medium,library,A Special Library,UCLA. They have over 10 libraries!
medium,library,A Special Library,That's one of the great perks of higher education.
medium,library,A Special Library,"Even though I have library cards, I really like this library."
medium,library,A Special Library,What do you like about it?
medium,library,A Special Library,I like the foreign language books. That's rare for any library.
medium,library,A Special Library,"Yes, it is! We get people all over the world because of that section."
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,"I really need a book, but I didn't see it on the shelf."
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,"According to the computer, it's not checked out yet."
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,Then why isn't it on the proper shelf?
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,It means that someone in this library is holding it right now.
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,So someone else has the book and plans on checking it out?
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,Either that or someone took it out of the shelf and misplaced it.
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,I really need that book.
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,You're going to have to look everywhere for it.
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,Can't you just make an announcement asking whoever has the book to come forward?
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,"You are not that special. When it comes to books, it's first come, first serve."
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,But I need it for school.
medium,library,Where Is the Book?,"I'm sorry, but I can't do anything for you."
medium,library,Tiger Books,"Hi, can you help me find a book on tigers?"
medium,library,Tiger Books,"Yes, of course. Is it for a school project?"
medium,library,Tiger Books,"Yes, I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger."
medium,library,Tiger Books,You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures.
medium,library,Tiger Books,But I want the one with pictures!
medium,library,Tiger Books,"Pictures are pretty, but they won't help you with your essay that much."
medium,library,Tiger Books,"Fine, I admit you're right."
medium,library,Tiger Books,You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure.
medium,library,Tiger Books,Yay! I love tigers.
medium,library,Tiger Books,"I have a book that isn't hard to understand, but still has great information."
medium,library,Tiger Books,Great! You're so helpful.
medium,library,Tiger Books,It's my job to be helpful.
medium,library,Reserving a Book,I would like to reserve The Hunger Games.
medium,library,Reserving a Book,Everyone wants to reserve that book these days.
medium,library,Reserving a Book,"It's really popular, because the movie just came out."
medium,library,Reserving a Book,You have to pay $1 to reserve the book.
medium,library,Reserving a Book,What?! That's ridiculous.
medium,library,Reserving a Book,"Like you said, it's popular."
medium,library,Reserving a Book,I have to think about it then.
medium,library,Reserving a Book,I personally think $1 is nothing. It's cheaper than buying the book.
medium,library,Reserving a Book,How much is the book?
medium,library,Reserving a Book,"On the back, it says it's $15. It depends on the bookstore you go to though."
medium,library,Reserving a Book,"Fine, I'll give you a $1."
medium,library,Reserving a Book,You won't regret it! The book is really good.
medium,library,Late Fees,"I'm sorry, but you can't borrow this book."
medium,library,Late Fees,What do you mean?
medium,library,Late Fees,You have not paid your late fees for your overdue books.
medium,library,Late Fees,I never had any overdue books!
medium,library,Late Fees,The computer doesn't lie.
medium,library,Late Fees,What books do I have late fees for?
medium,library,Late Fees,"They're all math books, and according to the system, you still have them."
medium,library,Late Fees,"Oh yeah, I do! I totally forgot about them and left them on my bed."
medium,library,Late Fees,"Once you return them and pay the fee, you can borrow books again."
medium,library,Late Fees,But I really need to borrow those books now.
medium,library,Late Fees,I can put them on hold for you.
medium,library,Late Fees,Yes! You are the best.
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,I'm so frustrated. I can't find any books on my research topic at my library.
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,Why don't you try a different library?
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,I don't want to waste gas money.
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,But you might find your book.
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,What library do you suggest?
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,I suggest the one near my house.
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,That is way too far for me.
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,They have a lot of books. That library has never disappointed me.
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,I have an idea! Why don't you borrow them for me?
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,I don't know about that. What if you lose the books?
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,I won't. I swear on my life.
medium,library,Borrowing a Book from Another Library,"Wow, you're so serious."
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,This is a great book you're checking out.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,You have read it?
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,Read it? I memorized it! It's one of my favorites.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,That's good to know.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,You should check out more books.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,I can check out more than one?
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,Of course! It would be crazy if you could only get one book.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,That's awesome! I'll be back.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,Don't go crazy now. The limit is 15 books.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,Don't worry. I'll probably come back with 5 more books.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,It's great to see a kid excited about reading.
medium,library,Checking Out a Book,"Yeah, most kids hate reading. They're more into television."
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,"Now, you can only check out this magazine for one week."
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,Why one week? I thought the borrowing time was two weeks.
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,That's for books only.
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,"Oh, that's weird."
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,"Well, it doesn't take that long to finish a magazine."
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,"I know, but I like to take my time."
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,I don't make the rules. Would you like to check it out?
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,"Yes, I'd like to check it out."
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,Interesting magazine choice. Reading about celebrities is not really smart of you.
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,Don't judge me. I can't read educational stuff all the time.
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,I do! I read Time and National Geographic.
medium,library,Checking Out a Magazine,Everyone's taste is different.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,How long do you want to check that video out for?
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,One week would be nice.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,That will be $5.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,What?! I thought I could check out videos for free.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,You can check out educational videos for free.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,This is bogus.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,It's still not a bad price.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,"Okay, what if I only borrow it for a day?"
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,It will be $2.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,"Okay, here's $2. So much for a library that services the public."
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,I hope you enjoy the movie.
medium,library,Checking Out a Video,"For 2 bucks, I'd better love the movie."
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,There's a huge rip here.
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,But there's tape on it!
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,Did you put the tape there?
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,"No, it was there before."
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,I know you're lying to me.
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,"If you know, then why did you ask if I put the tape on?"
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,I wanted to see if you were a liar or not.
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,How did you know I'm lying?
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,"Before you check out the book, the librarian checks it for damage."
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,"Wow, you guys think of everything."
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,"Yes. Anyways, you owe $10."
medium,library,Checking Books for Damage,"Fine, here you go."
medium,library,Barely Late,Here are the books I'm returning.
medium,library,Barely Late,Looks like they're late. The late fee is $5.
medium,library,Barely Late,"Okay, I'm only one minute late."
medium,library,Barely Late,"One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter."
medium,library,Barely Late,Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month.
medium,library,Barely Late,"Look, the point is - they're late."
medium,library,Barely Late,Screw you! I ain't payin $5.
medium,library,Barely Late,"I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again."
medium,library,Barely Late,"It's okay, because I don't even like this library."
medium,library,Barely Late,This library doesn't like you either!
medium,library,Barely Late,I am leaving! You are plain rude.
medium,library,Barely Late,Leave! Nobody wants to see you.
medium,library,Computer Limit,"Miss, you have been using the computer for over an hour now."
medium,library,Computer Limit,"I know, I'm sorry."
medium,library,Computer Limit,Are you looking for something?
medium,library,Computer Limit,I'm researching for my project.
medium,library,Computer Limit,Can you come back tomorrow? Your daily computer limit time is up.
medium,library,Computer Limit,I don't have a computer at home.
medium,library,Computer Limit,"I'm sorry to hear that, but other people need to use the computer, too."
medium,library,Computer Limit,My project is due very soon. I need to research.
medium,library,Computer Limit,How about books? This is a library after all.
medium,library,Computer Limit,I looked for books on my project. They're not good at all.
medium,library,Computer Limit,Maybe you don't know how to look for good books. I'll help you.
medium,library,Computer Limit,Thank you. I appreciate it.
medium,library,Using a Copier,How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?
medium,library,Using a Copier,It depends. Do you want your copy in color or black and white?
medium,library,Using a Copier,I want it in color.
medium,library,Using a Copier,Then it will be 20 cents per page.
medium,library,Using a Copier,That's kind of expensive.
medium,library,Using a Copier,"Yeah, but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own."
medium,library,Using a Copier,"I have one, but it's broken."
medium,library,Using a Copier,"That sucks. Well, if money's an issue, you can copy your stuff in black and white."

medium,employ,Express Dislikes,I have complained about the double shifts before.
medium,employ,Express Dislikes,What has management told you?
medium,employ,Express Dislikes,"They said they are hiring more people, and that this is temporary."
medium,employ,Express Dislikes,"I need this job, but I don't like these hours at all."

medium,travel,Shopping for Souvenirs,We can sightsee and buy souvenirs along the way.
medium,travel,Shopping for Souvenirs,Why don't we just buy souvenirs at the airport?
medium,travel,Shopping for Souvenirs,The airport charges way too much for souvenirs.
medium,travel,Shopping for Souvenirs,Our friends won't know the difference.
medium,travel,Shopping for Souvenirs,We will know!
medium,travel,Shopping for Souvenirs,"The hotel has postcards in the lobby, I think."
medium,travel,Shopping for Souvenirs,Postcards are to be mailed not given as souvenirs.

medium,vote,Disappointed at the Result,I think Republican mayors have been good for our city.
medium,vote,Disappointed at the Result,There's too much inequality.
medium,vote,Disappointed at the Result,You think this new mayor will change that?
medium,vote,Disappointed at the Result,You bet he will. It was his campaign promise.
medium,vote,Disappointed at the Result,Politicians make promises all the time. It doesn't mean anything.

medium,vote,Happy with the Result,I don't even know what that is like.
medium,vote,Happy with the Result,Exactly! There hasn't been a Democrat running this city in a long time.
medium,vote,Happy with the Result,I hope he will live up to all his campaign promises.
medium,vote,Happy with the Result,He will. The mayor elect is really sincere.
medium,vote,Happy with the Result,They all seem sincere in the beginning.
medium,vote,Happy with the Result,This is really going to turn the city around.
medium,vote,Happy with the Result,How will that happen?
medium,vote,Happy with the Result,Are your kidding? There will be better schools.

medium,buyhouse,Pre-Qualifying for a Loan,"By pre-qualifying, you know beforehand which house you can buy."
medium,buyhouse,Pre-Qualifying for a Loan,I thought I would look at houses first.
medium,buyhouse,Pre-Qualifying for a Loan,"That's okay too, but you may be wasting your time."
medium,buyhouse,Pre-Qualifying for a Loan,"How so, Mr. Williams?"
medium,buyhouse,Pre-Qualifying for a Loan,"You may find a house you really like, but can't afford it."
medium,buyhouse,Pre-Qualifying for a Loan,"Well, that's when I'll negotiate with the seller."

medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (1),Great! Let's go inside. It's a beautiful home.
medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (1),I don't like it already. The porch is too small. I have a big family.

medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (2),That's a good place to start.
medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (2),"This is the living area. As you can see, it's quite spacious."
medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (2),Uh huh. I see.
medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (2),And this is the master bedroom.
medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (2),"Sorry, it's a beautiful home, but it just doesn't feel right."
medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (2),"What's wrong, Mr. Jones?"
medium,buyhouse,Do not Like the House (2),"It's the lighting, and it just doesn't feel right, sorry."
medium,buyhouse,Find a House You Like,I'm sorry for being difficult.

medium,buyhouse,Re-offering and Acceptance,What about the appliances?
medium,buyhouse,Re-offering and Acceptance,"I'll take the appliances, but I want a limited warranty."
medium,buyhouse,Re-offering and Acceptance,For how long?
medium,buyhouse,Re-offering and Acceptance,I think six-months will suffice.
medium,buyhouse,Re-offering and Acceptance,"Well, I know this seller personally. I think we have a deal."

medium,sellhouse,Ready To Sell the House,I know. It makes me sad.
medium,sellhouse,Ready To Sell the House,"Why is that, Dorothy?"

medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,What suggestions?
medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,"I definitely want to have a ""For Sale"" sign on the lawn."
medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,That's funny. Don't all houses for sale have that?
medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,"No, not really. A lot of homes are just listed on the Internet."
medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,why do you want the sign then?
medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,I still think it is an effective tool in selling a house.
medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,"Okay, you're the boss."
medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,"We'll also have a listing online, so we can reach more people."
medium,sellhouse,Marketing the House,Sounds good to me. We should do well then.

medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Interior,"Why is that, Jonathan? Don't we have time?"
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Interior,"Yes, we do, but the sooner, the better."
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Interior,I guess so. Where do we start?
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Interior,I think the kitchen would be best.
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Interior,Why would the kitchen be best?
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Interior,I just think it's a very important room.
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Interior,"Well, yes. I guess we spend a lot of time there."

medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,It's time to start work.
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,"Okay, where do we start?"
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,The best place to start is the roof.
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,The roof? Isn't that dangerous?
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,"Don't be afraid. As long as we're careful, we'll be alright."
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,But I'm afraid of heights.
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,"I'll be there. Like I said, we'll be okay."
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,"Okay, I trust you."
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,"A good roof is very important. If it leaks, it can ruin the interior."
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,"Yes, I know. Remember Uncle Joe's house?"
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,I sure do. Let's get started.
medium,sellhouse,Fixing up the Exterior,Okay. I'm ready.

medium,sellhouse,Preparing for an Open house,"We cleaned the house, spruced up the yard, and painted the interior."

medium,sellhouse,Accepting an Offer,Yes. I have a serious offer on your house. This may be the one.
medium,sellhouse,Accepting an Offer,How close to the asking price is the offer?
medium,sellhouse,Accepting an Offer,"Very close. The offer is at $325,000."
medium,sellhouse,Accepting an Offer,Wow. That's great. That's almost what we listed it for.
medium,sellhouse,Accepting an Offer,"There are a couple of conditions though, but they're not too bad."
medium,sellhouse,Accepting an Offer,"Okay, I'm all ears. Let's go over them. I'm ready to sell."
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,"Good day, Thomas. We have an offer on your house."
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,That's good! I hope it's better than the last one.
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,"It is, Thomas."
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,"Okay, let's hear it."
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,"The offer is $275,000."
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,"$275,000! That's $35,000 under the listing."
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,"I know, Thomas, but I think we should consider it."
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,Why would I consider this price?
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,We should counteroffer. I think we can work with this buyer.
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,"I won't take less than $300,000. You know that."
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,Let's consider the counteroffer. The house has issues.
medium,sellhouse,Counteroffer,"Okay, I listen to you."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,"Mr. Smith, we received a counteroffer on your house."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,For which property?
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,It's for the lot on 6th Avenue.
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,"Okay, I've been waiting for this."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,"Yes, and I think it is a very good offer."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,"Okay, lay it on me."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,"The buyer upped his offer to $375,000."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,"Are you kidding me? That's still $7,500 below list."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,"I know, Mr. Smith, but the market is weak right now."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,I don't care. I'm not losing money on this.
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,"You won't be losing money, sir."
medium,sellhouse,Rejecting a Counteroffer,I don't care. I'm not selling at that price.
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,"The counteroffer we've been waiting for is here, Mr. Richards."
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,Finally. It's been nearly three weeks.
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,"Well, these things take some time."
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,"I know, but I wasn't happy with the original offer."
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,I think you'll be happy with this. The buyer is coming in just below list.
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,Exactly how much?
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,"They came in at $415,000, with very few conditions."
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,"Wow! That's only $10,000 below list. I didn't expect that."
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,"Neither did I, Mr. Richards."
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,What are the conditions?
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,They're not too bad. Mostly just to fix a few minor flaws.
medium,sellhouse,Accepting a Counteroffer,That's great. I think we'll take this counteroffer.
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,"Do you have any news for me, Daniel?"
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,"Yes, sir. I do."
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,That's good to hear. It's been a while since I've heard from you.
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,"We not have only one offer for your home, we have two."
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,Are they both serious offers?
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,"Yes, sir, they are."
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,"Okay, let's go over them."
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,The best one comes from the San Gabriel couple.
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,Why do you say that?
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,"The offers are the same in dollars, but they placed no conditions on the sale."
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,Really? They will buy as it is?
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,"Yes, sir, they will."
medium,sellhouse,Deciding Which Offer to Accept,Okay. I think we found our buyer then.
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,My dad told me he was going to put his second house in my name.
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,The one on Bronson Street?
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,"Yes, that's the one."
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,"Wow, that's a nice house."
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,"Yes, it is. He wants me to start taking on more responsibilities."
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,"Well, that will do it. It's not easy managing a home."
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,"I guess not, but I won't be living in it now."
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,So what's he doing?
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,He's just doing a Quit Claim deed.
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,What's that?
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,It's just a deed transfer changing ownership of the home.
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,It's not a sale?
medium,sellhouse,Deed Transfer,No. It's usually done between family members.
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,"Honey, where are the kitchen utensils?"
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,"I have no idea, Alicia. They're in one of these boxes."
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,I can't believe how much work is involved in moving out.
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,"I didn't expect this, either."
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,I hope this is the last time we move in a while.
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,"Me, too. I thought it was just a matter of calling a moving company, but wow!"
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,"That's just the beginning. Everything has to be organized, and packed first."
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,It's a good thing the kids are helping.
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,"Yes, and your brother, too. His truck has made this easier."
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,We've stayed in this house for a long time.
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,"Yes. It's time to move, but I don't want to go through this again."
medium,sellhouse,Preparing to Move Out,"We won't, Alicia. Remember, we got the house we wanted."

medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,They're here? They are early.
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,"Yes, I know. They're an hour early."
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,We're not ready yet. I'll tell them to come back.
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,"No, that's okay, dear. I'll go talk to them."
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,Are you sure?
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,"Yes, they can start loading the furniture while we pack the small stuff."
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,I guess that's okay.
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,We'll be fine. Most of the furniture is in the front anyway.
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,As long as they don't get in our way.
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,I'll tell them we're not done packing. It should be okay.
medium,sellhouse,Moving Day,It'd better be. They're very early.

medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,"We found the stores, and schools. It's time to find a church now."
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,Yes. I can't believe I forgot about that.
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,"We've been very busy, Marcy. That's okay."
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,How do we find one?
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,I guess we can call our old pastor.
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,That's right. He will know.
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,"It's either that, or check the Internet."
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,I think I like the pastor idea better.
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,Yes. He can probably give us the name of the local pastor.
medium,neighborhood,Find a Church,I'm so eager to start now.
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,There certainly are a lot of places to eat around here.
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,"Yes, there are. Where shall we go tonight?"
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,Why don't we ask our new neighbors for a recommendation?
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,That's a great idea. They seem very friendly.
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,"Yes, and they have lived here for a long time."
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,There she is. Let me ask her.
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,"What did she say, honey?"
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,She recommended a couple of places. What are you craving?
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,How about a nice steak?
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,Good. She said there was a good steak house about a mile away.
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,Excellent. Did you ask her if it was expensive.
medium,neighborhood,Find Places to Eat,"Yes, I did. She said it was very reasonable. Let's go."
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,"Now that we're settled in, it's time to do some exploring."
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,I know what you mean. Everything is so new.
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,I think I saw a shopping mall off the highway.
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,Was it far?
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,"Not really, but we did move to an isolated place."
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,"Yeah, I know. I didn't figure on this."
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,Let's go. It's not that far.
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,"Okay, I'll get ready."
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,"Alright, I'll get the car out. It's only about 15 minutes away."
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,I hope it has a lot of shops.
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,It looked pretty big.
medium,neighborhood,The Nearest Mall,"Okay, let's go."
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,"Hey, this is a nice library."
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,It is. I didn't expect this.
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,It doesn't look like much from the outside.
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,Didn't you know you can't tell a book by its cover?
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,"That's funny, babe."
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,"Anyway, we're going to need to get new library cards."
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,I'll go ask about it.
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,"Okay, I'm going to check the place out."
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,I went ahead and applied for a card. You need to do the same.
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,"I will right now, but look at this exhibit."
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,"Wow, it's beautiful. What is it?"
medium,neighborhood,At the Public Library,"I'm not sure, but I'm going to find out."
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,"It's time to go, Richard."
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,"Okay, Patty. I'm ready."
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,I'm really stoked about this new school. Judy is going to love it.

medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,Did you make an appointment?
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,"No, it wasn't necessary. They're enrolling new students this week."
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,"Okay, I just hope there're not too many people."
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,I think we'll be okay. There're not too many cars in the lot.
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,I'm glad we brought her transcripts. I think that will make this smoother.
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,"Yes, I'm sure it will. That was a good idea."
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,"Okay, let's get this done."
medium,neighborhood,Enrolling a Child in School,"I'm ready, babe."
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,I need to get to the airport by 6 o'clock.
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,That's in less than 45 minutes. You'll never make it.
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,I have to try. I was hoping to get the shuttle home.
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,Why did you wait so long?
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,It was my boss. He kept us late.
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,"Well, there goes a taxi."
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,"Taxi! Taxi! Darn, someone else got it."
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,You're going to have a hard time getting a taxi at this hour.
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,"I know, but what can I do? Taxi!"
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,"Well, good luck, George. I'm taking the subway."
medium,neighborhood,Hailing a Cab,"Okay, have a good weekend. Taxi!"

medium,neighborhood,Taking a Walk around a Park,Look at the swans. Do you see them?
medium,neighborhood,Taking a Walk around a Park,They're gorgeous. Look at how white those plumes are.
medium,neighborhood,Taking a Walk around a Park,And the lake looks so calm.
medium,neighborhood,Taking a Walk around a Park,It does. This was a great idea.
medium,neighborhood,Taking a Walk around a Park,I know. I do this walk often.
medium,neighborhood,Taking a Walk around a Park,I didn't even think it was that far; it's so beautiful.
medium,neighborhood,Playing with Kids at the Park,Let's take the kids to the park.
medium,neighborhood,Playing with Kids at the Park,"Hey, that sounds like a good idea!"
medium,neighborhood,Playing with Kids at the Park,"Yes, the fresh air will do them good."
medium,neighborhood,Playing with Kids at the Park,"Yeah, they've been cooped up all week."
medium,neighborhood,Playing with Kids at the Park,It's like summer out today.
medium,neighborhood,Playing with Kids at the Park,"Okay, I'll get them ready."
medium,neighborhood,Playing with Kids at the Park,There is so much to do there.
medium,neighborhood,Playing with Kids at the Park,"What, like swings, and rides?"

medium,entertain,A New Game,What are you playing?
medium,entertain,A New Game,It's a new game I downloaded on my iPhone.
medium,entertain,A New Game,Is it fun?
medium,entertain,A New Game,Yes! I really like competing with my friends.
medium,entertain,A New Game,You can compare your scores with other people?
medium,entertain,A New Game,"That's right! If you get a higher score, the game gives you prizes."
medium,entertain,A New Game,What kinds of prizes?
medium,entertain,A New Game,"Better equipment for your character, or even weapons."
medium,entertain,A New Game,That game sounds like a lot of fun!
medium,entertain,A New Game,It really is! You should download it.
medium,entertain,A New Game,Alright! Then I can compete against you!
medium,entertain,A New Game,"In that case, get ready to lose!"
medium,entertain,A Comic Book,Have you read the new Batman comic issue?

medium,entertain,A Comic Book,It's really amazing!
medium,entertain,A Comic Book,I love this series. The villains are so cool!
medium,entertain,A Comic Book,I know what you mean. They have great backstories!
medium,entertain,A Comic Book,I never get tired of reading Batman.
medium,entertain,A Comic Book,I wonder if they will make another movie soon.
medium,entertain,A Comic Book,"I like the comics better than the movies, though."
medium,entertain,A Comic Book,"Me too, but comics don't have special effects!"
medium,entertain,A Comic Book,"I guess the movies have their perks, too."
medium,entertain,Anime Series,Why do you seem so tired today?
medium,entertain,Anime Series,I stayed up all night watching that new anime.
medium,entertain,Anime Series,You stayed up to watch it again?
medium,entertain,Anime Series,I just had to find out what happened next!
medium,entertain,Anime Series,I don't think it's good to watch so many cartoons.
medium,entertain,Anime Series,Anime series are not cartoons!
medium,entertain,Anime Series,"Of course, they are! They're drawn and colored."
medium,entertain,Anime Series,Anime is not for children. The stories are more intense.
medium,entertain,Anime Series,I think you're just telling yourself that.
medium,entertain,Anime Series,Cartoons don't have storylines like anime series do.
medium,entertain,Anime Series,"Either way, it's just a silly television show."
medium,entertain,Anime Series,You really don't understand the life of a fan.
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,You sure are buying a lot of snacks.
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,That's because I'm going on a long car trip.
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,Where are you driving to?
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,I'm driving to Comic-Con in San Diego this weekend.
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,You're driving all the way there to read comic books?
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,No. I will be meeting comic artists and voice actors.
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,That sounds really impressive!
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,"If I'm lucky, I'll even meet Stan Lee!"
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,Is he as famous as Bruce Lee?
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,Stan Lee is a famous comic book writer and creator.
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,I think I'd be more impressed to meet Bruce Lee.
medium,entertain,Comic-Con,Bruce Lee wouldn't stand a chance against Stan's heroes!
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,What are we doing here at the park? We haven't played here since we were children.
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,That's exactly why it would be so much fun!
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,I'd rather go to the movies.
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,Just sit on the swings for a while. I bet I can go higher!
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,"You sound like a kid, alright."
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,"Kids are the best at having fun, you know."
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,"I have to admit, this does bring back some memories."
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,I still think the playground is pretty entertaining.
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,Maybe we should come swing every once in a while.
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,I think I'd be up to do something like that.
medium,entertain,Sitting on the Swings,Cheapest form of entertainment ever!
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,Have you been in your room all day?

medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,It's already evening! What have you been doing?
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,I've been reading a very interesting book.
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,That is exactly why I don't like reading.
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,Why don't you like reading?
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,You could have watched three movies by now!
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,Books are always much better than movies.
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,The Hunger Games movies are pretty good.
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,They leave out a lot of the best details!
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,It's probably because the details were not that important.
medium,entertain,Enjoy Reading,Details are what makes life interesting!
medium,entertain,LARPing,Why are you dressed in that weird costume?
medium,entertain,LARPing,I'm going LARPing with some friends.
medium,entertain,LARPing,What's LARPing?
medium,entertain,LARPing,It stands for Live Action Role Playing.
medium,entertain,LARPing,What do you do when you LARP?
medium,entertain,LARPing,You dress up as someone and do things in character.
medium,entertain,LARPing,That sounds really ridiculous.
medium,entertain,LARPing,"It's really fun, actually."
medium,entertain,LARPing,Don't you feel silly wearing that in public?
medium,entertain,LARPing,It's all part of the fun!
medium,entertain,LARPing,"While you do that, I think I'll go to the arcade."
medium,entertain,LARPing,"Alright, but you're missing out!"
medium,entertain,Arcade,I love playing all of these old fashioned games!
medium,entertain,Arcade,"Me, too! Too bad it's so expensive."
medium,entertain,Arcade,I wish they'd cost nickels instead of quarters.
medium,entertain,Arcade,I think that would lose the arcade a lot of money.
medium,entertain,Arcade,"Maybe, but it would get them a lot of new customers."
medium,entertain,Arcade,"Despite the high cost, these games are a lot of fun."
medium,entertain,Arcade,Look at these old graphics!
medium,entertain,Arcade,It's funny to think they were once considered high-tech.
medium,entertain,Arcade,I used to be really good at this game when I was a kid.
medium,entertain,Arcade,My brother and I used to compete all the time.
medium,entertain,Arcade,Let's see who gets a higher score!
medium,entertain,Arcade,Maybe tomorrow. I'm already out of quarters.
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,I don't think I'd like to be famous.
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,Why not? It seems like a good lifestyle.
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,There would always be paparazzi following me everywhere.
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,I guess that would be really annoying.
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,It would be impossible to get any peace and quiet.
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,Not to mention the lack of privacy.
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,"I'd love to be in an action movie, though!"
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,Why do you want to be in an action movie?
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,Then I could say that I was a superhero!
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,I don't think anyone would believe that you're a superhero.
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,They would if I was in an action movie!
medium,entertain,Movie Stars,"Like I said before, that's never going to happen."
medium,entertain,Awards Show,I love it when people fall on the red carpet!
medium,entertain,Awards Show,Why would you like watching that?
medium,entertain,Awards Show,It's funny to see someone famous fall!
medium,entertain,Awards Show,I think it's mean to laugh at anyone falling.
medium,entertain,Awards Show,You laughed at me when I fell last time!
medium,entertain,Awards Show,"Well, how would you like it if you fell on national TV?"
medium,entertain,Awards Show,I guess that would be embarrassing.
medium,entertain,Awards Show,You should always put yourself in others' shoes!
medium,entertain,Awards Show,"I still think it's pretty funny, though."
medium,entertain,Awards Show,Haven't you learned your lesson?
medium,entertain,Awards Show,"Yes. If I fell on national TV, I'd be the first person to laugh."
medium,entertain,Awards Show,I guess that's a good attitude to have.
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,I want to watch a movie.
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,Nothing good is playing at the theater.
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,"That's true. Plus, I don't have much money."
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,Do you have a Netflix account?
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,"No, I don't."
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,Why don't we go rent a movie?
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,Is it expensive?
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,"No, just a couple of dollars."
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,"We can buy some snacks, too."
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,It will be like a mini trip to the movies.
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,That sounds good to me! Let's go.
medium,entertain,Movie Rental,I'm right behind you!
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,What are you playing?
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,I'm playing a new game I bought yesterday.
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,Is it one of those shooting games?
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,"No, it's not a shooting game."
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,Is it a sports game?
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,It's a role-playing game.
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,What's a role-playing game?
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,You play as a character and complete missions.
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,That doesn't sound too hard.
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,Some of the missions take a lot of cleverness!
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,Then I'll stick to shooting games.
medium,entertain,Not a Shooting Game,All that'll do is kill your brain cells.
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,I've run out of money for my iTunes!
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,You used it all up already?
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,I bought my favorite artists' albums today.
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,You must really like their music.
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,I do! There is no other like it.
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,Have you ever watched a live concert?
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,"No, but I hope to, someday!"
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,"Until then, maybe you should refill your iTunes card."
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,I think I'll just use it all up again.
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,Then maybe you have all you need for now.
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,I'm going to look up her concerts on YouTube!
medium,entertain,Enthusiastic Fan,That's a better idea!
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,Can you record the new episode of Clarence for me?
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,Why don't you watch it yourself?
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,I won't be home that day and my Internet is down.
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,"Okay, I'll record it since I know it's your favorite show."
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,Thank you in advance!
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,"It may be a good chance to watch it myself, actually."
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,I really recommend it! It's cute and funny.
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,Have you watched the shows I recommended to you?
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,"No, but I will once my Internet works again."
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,We can have a day that we get together to watch TV shows.
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,That sounds like a lot of fun!
medium,entertain,Record it for Me,"It's a plan, then!"
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,Have you ever been to the opera before?
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,"No, but I hear it's very beautiful."
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,Is it true that opera is sung in a foreign language?
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,"Yes, usually in Italian or French."
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,How are we supposed to know what's going on?
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,The actors also tell the story with their actions.
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,It seems a bit confusing to me.
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,"The music is supposed to be beautiful, regardless."
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,Are they accompanied by an orchestra?
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,"Yes, a very large one with talented performers."
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,"I suppose the music will tell a story, too."
medium,entertain,Beautiful Opera,Yes. Music is a universal language.

hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Hi. How can I help you today?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Oh, that's not good. What happened?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you have any clue who might have done this?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Why, what leads you to that suspicion?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, a baseball is certainly solid evidence."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I saw them playing just before I left my apartment.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, did you recognize any of them?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"No, I just took a quick look."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, it'll take a couple of days to repair it."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,A friend of mine is in the business. How about if I call him?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"That's okay by me. First, let me come see the damage."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Come on over. So does my friend charge you or me?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Since you didn't break it, you don't have to pay for it."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,That's a relief. I thought I was going to get stuck with the bill.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"If I knew which kid did it, I would bill his parents."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm Janet Smith in apartment 23. Is this the apartment manager?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Hello. What can I do for you today?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,My living room window is broken.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Are you serious? Do you know what happened?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"I am not really sure, because I was out when it occurred."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you have any idea who might have been behind this?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Something tells me it might be some of the kids in the complex.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,What led you to think it might be the kids in this building?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I found a baseball near the broken glass.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, you can't ignore a baseball in your living room, can you?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I saw them in the lot just before I went out.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you know any of them?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"I'll call the window repairman, but it'll probably take a couple of days."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I could get fast service if I call a friend of mine.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I don't have a problem with that. Let me look at the damage first.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Okay, I'm waiting for you. But who does my friend give the bill to?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Since the kids broke it, your friend can bill me."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Whew! I was worried that I would have to pay for it.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Believe me, if I find out which kid broke the window, I'll bill his parents."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. May I speak to the apartment manager?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Speaking. What can I do for you?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Something happened to my window. It's broken.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,That doesn't sound good. Do you know how it happened?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I don't know the exact details.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you have an idea who might be responsible for the window?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm almost sure it is the local kids in the apartments.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,How did you come to that conclusion?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,There was a baseball in my living room along with the broken glass.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, at least there's no mystery about how it happened."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I saw a group of them playing in the lot just before I went out to my car.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Can you tell me which ones you recognized?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I just looked at them for a second.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"I'll call a repairman, but it might take two days."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want to get stuck with the bill.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I will bill the kid's parents if I ever find out which kid did it.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Hello, I'm John Smith in unit 23. Am I speaking to the apartment manager?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,This is he. How may I help you?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,My window that faces the empty lot is broken.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm sorry to hear that. Why is it broken?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I can't tell you exactly how it happened.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, tell me what you think might have happened."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I've got a pretty good idea that it's the kids who live here.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Why do you think that?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Next to the broken glass in my living room was a baseball.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, you don't need Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out, do you?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Just before I went shopping, I saw them in the lot."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Can you give me a name or two, or a description?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I have absolutely no idea.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"I'll call a repairman for you, but it'll probably take one or two days."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"I could probably get it fixed today, because a friend of mine is a repairman."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,That's okay. But let me see the damage first. I'm coming over.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"The glass is all cleaned up, so come on over. But do I pay for this?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"No. I will pay your friend, or I will reimburse you if you pay him."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,That's good news. I was worried you were going to make me pay for this.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,You're not at fault. But the kid who did it is.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,This is John Smith in unit 23. Is this the apartment manager?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Hi. What do you need today?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I've got a broken living room window.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm sorry about that. How did it get broken?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"I've got a good idea, but I'm not exactly sure."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, why don't you give me a few details?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I would bet a dollar to a dime that it's one of the local kids.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you have any support for that charge?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,A baseball was on my living room carpet. I don't own a baseball.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, it sounds like someone hit a home run."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,I saw them playing ball in the lot just before I went to the market.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you know for sure who they were?
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,All I did was glance at them before I left.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"If you like, I'll call a repairman, but it might take a few days."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,How about if I call my friend? He's a repairman and could probably fix it today.
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Sure. Let me come over to see the damage right now, though."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Sure, come on over, but tell me, do I have to pay for this?"
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"You're not responsible, so you don't pay. Tell him to bill me."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, lucky me. I was afraid that I was going to get stuck for the bill."
hard,1apartment,A Broken Window,Maybe I'll install a camera on that end of the building to catch these kids.

hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"When I turn on the switch, nothing happens."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,When did you first notice this?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,A week ago it started sounding different.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,What key?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,My garbage disposal isn't working.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Can you be a little more specific?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Nothing happens when I turn on the switch.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Do you remember how it started?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,about a week ago I noticed a new sound.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,That's interesting. I never heard that before.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,My garbage disposal went south.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Does it turn at all?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Did it die suddenly?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,It started to make a weird sound last week.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"No, that's against the law, isn't it? I only use it on soft food, maybe once a week."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Once a week might not be enough, huh?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hi, Hannah. What's up?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Is it dying, or is it dead?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Last week I noticed that it sounded strange.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Try loosening it up by using the disposal key.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Sometimes the key works, sometimes it doesn't. I still might have to call a plumber."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"If we don't fix it sometime, your apartment might start to attract bugs or rodents."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Yes, this is John Smith."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news."

hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Oh, of course. When you said fees, I was thinking of parking fees or something."

hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,The apartment owner was impressed with your interview. He has approved your rental application.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Oh, my gosh. That's wonderful news!"
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,Fees? I don't remember anything about fees.
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,No sooner said than done. Where shall I mail it?

hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You know, the security deposit, and the first and last month's rent."
hard,1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Oh, I got it. I thought you were talking about something else."

hard,health,Health Insurance,Have you ever purchased health insurance before?
hard,health,Health Insurance,"I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices."
hard,health,Health Insurance,Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?

hard,health,Health Insurance,"The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere you like."

hard,health,Health Insurance,"If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO?"
hard,health,Health Insurance,"By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in"
hard,health,Health Insurance,out-of-pocket expenses.

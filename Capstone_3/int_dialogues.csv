smalltalk,Weather (1),It's an ugly day today.
smalltalk,Weather (1),I know. I think it may rain.
smalltalk,Weather (1),"It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today."
smalltalk,Weather (1),That would be weird.
smalltalk,Weather (1),"Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside."
smalltalk,Weather (1),"I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside."
smalltalk,Weather (1),"Yes, it would be."
smalltalk,Weather (1),I really wish it wasn't so hot every day.
smalltalk,Weather (1),Me too. I can't wait until winter.
smalltalk,Weather (1),"I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold."
smalltalk,Weather (1),I'd rather be cold than hot.
smalltalk,Weather (1),Me too.
smalltalk,Weather (1),It doesn't look very nice outside today.
smalltalk,Weather (1),You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
smalltalk,Weather (1),"In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining."
smalltalk,Weather (1),That wouldn't seem right.
smalltalk,Weather (1),"Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird."
smalltalk,Weather (1),"Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot."
smalltalk,Weather (1),"I know, you're absolutely right."
smalltalk,Weather (1),I wish it would cool off one day.
smalltalk,Weather (1),"That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon."

smalltalk,Weather (1),I wish it was a nicer day today.
smalltalk,Weather (1),That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
smalltalk,Weather (1),It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
smalltalk,Weather (1),It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
smalltalk,Weather (1),It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
smalltalk,Weather (1),Any rain right now would be pointless.
smalltalk,Weather (1),"That's right, it really would be."
smalltalk,Weather (1),I want it to cool down some.
smalltalk,Weather (1),"I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter."
smalltalk,Weather (1),Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
smalltalk,Weather (1),I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
smalltalk,Weather (1),I feel the same way.
smalltalk,Weather (2),It's such a nice day.

smalltalk,Weather (2),"Yes, and I hope that it does."
smalltalk,Weather (2),Why is that?
smalltalk,Weather (2),I really love how rain clears the air.
smalltalk,Weather (2),Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains.
smalltalk,Weather (2),"Yes, but I love the night air after it rains."
smalltalk,Weather (2),Really? Why is it?
smalltalk,Weather (2),Because you can see the stars perfectly.
smalltalk,Weather (2),I really hope it rains today.
smalltalk,Weather (2),"Yeah, me too."
smalltalk,Weather (2),Isn't it a nice day?

smalltalk,Weather (2),The stars look so much closer after it rains.
smalltalk,Weather (2),I really want it to rain today.
smalltalk,Weather (2),"Yeah, so do I."
smalltalk,Weather (2),Don't you think it's nice out?

smalltalk,Weather (2),I think that it's going to rain.
smalltalk,Weather (2),I hope that it does rain.
smalltalk,Weather (2),You like the rain?
smalltalk,Weather (2),The sky looks so clean after it rains. I love it.

smalltalk,4. Weather (3),I know. I really want to go to the beach.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),"You're right. One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold."
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),I really wish the weather would just stay the same.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),I do too. That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),"Yeah, that would make things a lot easier."

smalltalk,4. Weather (3),It sounds like it will be.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),I really hope it doesn't get cold.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),"That would ruin things, I want to go so badly."
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),"The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know."
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),That is true. The weather is constantly changing.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),It would be nice if the weather would never change.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),"That would be great, then we could plan things sooner."

smalltalk,4. Weather (3),Will it be good beach weather?

smalltalk,4. Weather (3),It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),"I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm."
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),"This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen."
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),I know. Every day the weather seems different.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),That would make it easier for us to make plans.
smalltalk,4. Weather (3),I know. Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.

collegelife,. Parking at School,Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have you seen those signs?
collegelife,. Parking at School,"Yes, I have seen those signs."
collegelife,. Parking at School,The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do you know how to read the curb colors?
collegelife,. Parking at School,"Yes, I know what the curb colors mean."
collegelife,. Parking at School,"Well, just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading, I think you know what you need to know."
collegelife,. Parking at School,Where should I park?
collegelife,. Parking at School,Do you have a car or motorbike?
collegelife,. Parking at School,I drive a scooter
collegelife,. Parking at School,"In that case, you can park either in a student lot or on the street. Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots?"
collegelife,. Parking at School,"No, I haven't seen those spots."
collegelife,. Parking at School,The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit. Will you mostly be parking during the day or night?

collegelife,. Parking at School,Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only. I think you'll be good to go!
collegelife,. Parking at School,What is the best place to park?
collegelife,. Parking at School,What vehicle do you usually bring to school? Is it an automobile or a motorbike?
collegelife,. Parking at School,I drive a motorcycle.
collegelife,. Parking at School,OK. That means you can park in the student lot or on the street. Have you seen the handicapped spots?
collegelife,. Parking at School,I am not sure what a handicapped spot is.
collegelife,. Parking at School,Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces. Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening?

collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?"
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,I was there too long.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Yeah, I saw it."
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Yeah, I understand."
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge."
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Yeah, you're right."
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"OK, I will."
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Good luck!
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Man, I got another parking ticket. I am so unlucky--what can I do?"
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?"
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,I could tell what I was supposed to do.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,That's too bad. That means that you can't use receipts or a witness to help you out.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,I guess not.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it."
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Sure, if it will help."
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Sounds good!
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Give it your best shot; it might work.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,I don't know how to fight a parking ticket.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Did you get written up for exceeding the time limit or for parking where you weren't supposed to be?
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Both.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,I was confused.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"If it might work, I'll go for it!"
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Let the judge see that you are only a poor starving student who won't do it again.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,I can see how that might work.
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,"Without actually saying that the parking ticket guy was an idiot, make it seem as though it was HIS mistake, not yours!"
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,I could do that!
collegelife,. Fighting a Parking Ticket,Try it. It just might save you the price of a parking ticket.

dating,6. An Argument,"John, I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year."
dating,6. An Argument,"I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend, Mark."
dating,6. An Argument,What are you talking about?
dating,6. An Argument,What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation?
dating,6. An Argument,"You and I have been together for a whole year, and our vacation time should be about the two of us!"
dating,6. An Argument,Really? Who made that rule up?
dating,6. An Argument,"With that attitude, I don't really think we have much more to discuss here."
dating,6. An Argument,That works for me!
dating,6. An Argument,"John, I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year."
dating,6. An Argument,"I've already told my buddy, Mark, that I am going hunting with him in Alaska."
dating,6. An Argument,You can't be serious!
dating,6. An Argument,"Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. I am sorry that bothers you."
dating,6. An Argument,"After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together."

dating,6. An Argument,"Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year, John."
dating,6. An Argument,I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska.
dating,6. An Argument,Are you kidding me?
dating,6. An Argument,"You know what? You and I had no plans, so I made plans with Mark. What's the problem?"
dating,6. An Argument,"We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a year, take their vacation together."
dating,6. An Argument,I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before. Any more rules that you would like to tell me about?
dating,6. An Argument,"Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back, why don't you just move in with him as well!"
dating,6. An Argument,I am really looking forward to getting away from you. Far away from you!

dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,I was thinking that I would like to see The Secret Life of Bees.

dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,"Hey Joe, how have you been?"
dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,"I am doing well. How about you, Mary?"
dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,"I am doing OK, Joe."

dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,I could go to the movies on Friday night instead. Would that be better?
dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,Did you have a certain movie in mind?
dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice.
dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,I kind of wanted to see The Secret Life of Bees.
dating,7. Rejecting an Invitation,Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie!

1apartment,A Broken Window,Hi. How can I help you today?
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Oh, that's not good. What happened?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened.
1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you have any clue who might have done this?
1apartment,A Broken Window,I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Why, what leads you to that suspicion?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, a baseball is certainly solid evidence."
1apartment,A Broken Window,I saw them playing just before I left my apartment.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, did you recognize any of them?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,"No, I just took a quick look."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, it'll take a couple of days to repair it."
1apartment,A Broken Window,A friend of mine is in the business. How about if I call him?
1apartment,A Broken Window,"That's okay by me. First, let me come see the damage."
1apartment,A Broken Window,Come on over. So does my friend charge you or me?
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Since you didn't break it, you don't have to pay for it."
1apartment,A Broken Window,That's a relief. I thought I was going to get stuck with the bill.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"If I knew which kid did it, I would bill his parents."
1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm Janet Smith in apartment 23. Is this the apartment manager?
1apartment,A Broken Window,Hello. What can I do for you today?
1apartment,A Broken Window,My living room window is broken.
1apartment,A Broken Window,Are you serious? Do you know what happened?
1apartment,A Broken Window,"I am not really sure, because I was out when it occurred."
1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you have any idea who might have been behind this?
1apartment,A Broken Window,Something tells me it might be some of the kids in the complex.
1apartment,A Broken Window,What led you to think it might be the kids in this building?
1apartment,A Broken Window,I found a baseball near the broken glass.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, you can't ignore a baseball in your living room, can you?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,I saw them in the lot just before I went out.
1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you know any of them?
1apartment,A Broken Window,"No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"I'll call the window repairman, but it'll probably take a couple of days."
1apartment,A Broken Window,I could get fast service if I call a friend of mine.
1apartment,A Broken Window,I don't have a problem with that. Let me look at the damage first.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Okay, I'm waiting for you. But who does my friend give the bill to?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Since the kids broke it, your friend can bill me."
1apartment,A Broken Window,Whew! I was worried that I would have to pay for it.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Believe me, if I find out which kid broke the window, I'll bill his parents."
1apartment,A Broken Window,This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. May I speak to the apartment manager?
1apartment,A Broken Window,Speaking. What can I do for you?
1apartment,A Broken Window,Something happened to my window. It's broken.
1apartment,A Broken Window,That doesn't sound good. Do you know how it happened?
1apartment,A Broken Window,I don't know the exact details.
1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you have an idea who might be responsible for the window?
1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm almost sure it is the local kids in the apartments.
1apartment,A Broken Window,How did you come to that conclusion?
1apartment,A Broken Window,There was a baseball in my living room along with the broken glass.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, at least there's no mystery about how it happened."
1apartment,A Broken Window,I saw a group of them playing in the lot just before I went out to my car.
1apartment,A Broken Window,Can you tell me which ones you recognized?
1apartment,A Broken Window,I just looked at them for a second.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"I'll call a repairman, but it might take two days."
1apartment,A Broken Window,How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?
1apartment,A Broken Window,That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,"You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly."
1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want to get stuck with the bill.
1apartment,A Broken Window,I will bill the kid's parents if I ever find out which kid did it.
1apartment,A Broken Window,4.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Hello, I'm John Smith in unit 23. Am I speaking to the apartment manager?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,This is he. How may I help you?
1apartment,A Broken Window,My window that faces the empty lot is broken.
1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm sorry to hear that. Why is it broken?
1apartment,A Broken Window,I can't tell you exactly how it happened.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, tell me what you think might have happened."
1apartment,A Broken Window,I've got a pretty good idea that it's the kids who live here.
1apartment,A Broken Window,Why do you think that?
1apartment,A Broken Window,Next to the broken glass in my living room was a baseball.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, you don't need Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out, do you?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Just before I went shopping, I saw them in the lot."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Can you give me a name or two, or a description?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,I have absolutely no idea.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"I'll call a repairman for you, but it'll probably take one or two days."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"I could probably get it fixed today, because a friend of mine is a repairman."
1apartment,A Broken Window,That's okay. But let me see the damage first. I'm coming over.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"The glass is all cleaned up, so come on over. But do I pay for this?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,"No. I will pay your friend, or I will reimburse you if you pay him."
1apartment,A Broken Window,That's good news. I was worried you were going to make me pay for this.
1apartment,A Broken Window,You're not at fault. But the kid who did it is.
1apartment,A Broken Window,5.
1apartment,A Broken Window,This is John Smith in unit 23. Is this the apartment manager?
1apartment,A Broken Window,Hi. What do you need today?
1apartment,A Broken Window,I've got a broken living room window.
1apartment,A Broken Window,I'm sorry about that. How did it get broken?
1apartment,A Broken Window,"I've got a good idea, but I'm not exactly sure."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, why don't you give me a few details?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,I would bet a dollar to a dime that it's one of the local kids.
1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you have any support for that charge?
1apartment,A Broken Window,A baseball was on my living room carpet. I don't own a baseball.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, it sounds like someone hit a home run."
1apartment,A Broken Window,I saw them playing ball in the lot just before I went to the market.
1apartment,A Broken Window,Do you know for sure who they were?
1apartment,A Broken Window,All I did was glance at them before I left.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"If you like, I'll call a repairman, but it might take a few days."
1apartment,A Broken Window,How about if I call my friend? He's a repairman and could probably fix it today.
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Sure. Let me come over to see the damage right now, though."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Sure, come on over, but tell me, do I have to pay for this?"
1apartment,A Broken Window,"You're not responsible, so you don't pay. Tell him to bill me."
1apartment,A Broken Window,"Well, lucky me. I was afraid that I was going to get stuck for the bill."
1apartment,A Broken Window,Maybe I'll install a camera on that end of the building to catch these kids.

1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates."
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,Is partying one of your priorities?
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,I'm a student. I don't have time to party.
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?"
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too."
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,What time do you usually hit the sack?
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day."

1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"Your answers are great. Now, do you have a question or two for me?"
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,Just one question. What's the parking situation?
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"This place allows only one parking space per apartment, so you'll have to park on the street."
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"I don't like it, but I guess I can live with it."
1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"Okay, I think we'll be good roommates. Just call me when you're ready to move in."

1apartment,4. Interviewing a Potential Roommate,"Yes, is the parking off street, or on street?"

1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Oh, hi, Hannah."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,There is something wrong with my garbage disposal.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Exactly what's going on?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,When did this happen?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, no one ever told me that."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,I don't have a key.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,My garbage disposal refuses to work.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,What happens when you turn on the switch?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"When I turn on the switch, nothing happens."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,When did you first notice this?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,A week ago it started sounding different.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,What key?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,My garbage disposal isn't working.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Can you be a little more specific?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Nothing happens when I turn on the switch.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Do you remember how it started?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,about a week ago I noticed a new sound.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,That's interesting. I never heard that before.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,4.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,My garbage disposal went south.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Does it turn at all?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Did it die suddenly?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,It started to make a weird sound last week.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"No, that's against the law, isn't it? I only use it on soft food, maybe once a week."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Once a week might not be enough, huh?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,5.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Hi, Hannah. What's up?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Is it dying, or is it dead?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Last week I noticed that it sounded strange.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Try loosening it up by using the disposal key.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Sometimes the key works, sometimes it doesn't. I still might have to call a plumber."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"If we don't fix it sometime, your apartment might start to attract bugs or rodents."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Yes, this is John Smith."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Great, what is it?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you.

1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Oh, that's so good. It makes my day."

1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Fees, what are you talking about?"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You know--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."

1apartment,Asking about Checks,The apartment owner was impressed with your interview. He has approved your rental application.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Oh, my gosh. That's wonderful news!"
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Fees? I don't remember anything about fees.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit."

1apartment,Asking about Checks,"You know, the security deposit, and the first and last month's rent."
1apartment,Asking about Checks,"Oh, I got it. I thought you were talking about something else."

1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,I can't find my mailbox key.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Is that all? That's a lot better than losing your car keys.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"I had a duplicate, but I can't find it either."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"If you come by my place, I can loan you a key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,There's no emergency. All I get is junk mail and bills.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Sure, that'll be fine."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Okay. I'll see you Wednesday. But it's going to cost you $2 per key.

1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"To make matters worse, I can't find my duplicate either."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"If you want, come over here and I'll lend you a key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"No, there's nothing vital in the mailbox. Just junk and bills."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"If you can wait until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Wednesday's fine.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Okay, I'll bring them by Wednesday. Have $4 ready for me."

1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"As if that wasn't bad enough, I also misplaced the duplicate."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Well, if it's an emergency, come by here and I'll lend you a key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"No, even if there's a bill in there, it can wait."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"If you don't mind waiting until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Oh, I can wait, believe me."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Okay, see you Wednesday. They're not free, you know. It'll be $4."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,4.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Hey, Nicole. It's Jimmy in 309."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Hi there, Jimmy. What can I do for you?"
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"I screwed up, and I need your help."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Tell me the specific problem. Let me see what I can do.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"I've torn my apartment apart, but I can't find my mailbox key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Well, you should be grateful it wasn't your car keys."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"On top of that, I couldn't find the duplicate either."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"If you need to get in there, come by and borrow a key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"No, my mailbox is usually empty anyway."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Well, then, I'll make you two more keys on Wednesday."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,No problem. I can wait till Wednesday. Maybe there'll be something in there by then.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Okay. Have $4 ready for when you see me Wednesday.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,5.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Hello? This is Jimmy in 309.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's going on?"
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Maybe you can get me out of a small jam.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Well, I can certainly try."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Somehow, I managed to lose my mailbox key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Believe me, losing a mailbox key is a lot better than losing your car keys."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"I've got a duplicate somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it either."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"If you absolutely can't wait, come over here and borrow a key."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"No, I doubt that there's anything important in my mailbox, if there's anything at all."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Well, if there's no emergency, I can make you two more keys on Wednesday."
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,Not a problem. All my fan mail can wait till then.
1apartment,9. Mailbox Key Missing,"Okay, see you Wednesday. Have $4 for me, and I'll give you a receipt."

1apartment,Asking about Checks,I'll be teaching ESL at Pasadena City College.
1apartment,Asking about Checks,Great! Is ESL a class about the Internet?
1apartment,Asking about Checks,No. ESL is English for students whose native language is not English.

buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,You can either make an appointment by going online or by calling the phone number listed on their website.

buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,"It would be nice not to have to go in but if I have to, how do I make an appointment?"
buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,"The easiest way to contact them is online, but they also have a phone number listed on the website if you prefer to call them on the phone."
buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,What do they do if you just show up with no appointment?
buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,That is not a good way to go. You could be left waiting for many hours and there is no guarantee that they will see you at all!
buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,What about going to the DMV on Saturday?
buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,"For a while the DMV was open on Saturday, but not anymore."
buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,I think that the Automobile Club idea was a good suggestion.
buycar,7. Making an Appointment with the DMV,You should check out the Automobile Club. I think you would enjoy being a member.

health,Health Insurance,Could you explain the difference to me?
health,Health Insurance,"To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your own doctor."
health,Health Insurance,"When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO?"
health,Health Insurance,"The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere you like."
health,Health Insurance,How much will an HMO cost me per month?
health,Health Insurance,"Go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your information, we can give you a quote."
health,Health Insurance,I am calling to purchase health insurance.

health,Health Insurance,choose certain doctors.
health,Health Insurance,"When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a PPO?"
health,Health Insurance,The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their doctors.

health,Health Insurance,"If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO?"
health,Health Insurance,"By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in"
health,Health Insurance,out-of-pocket expenses.
health,Health Insurance,Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO?

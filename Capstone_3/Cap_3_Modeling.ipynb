    "This is the stage of the project where we finally build a chatbot!  Actually we are going to build two, and compare how well they work. We are going to use Chatterbot, a Python library for building chatbots that is relatively easy to use. During my time as a teacher, one of the most common things I heard from my students was that they wanted their errors to be corrected. This is especially true of simple errors related to content the student has seen before. I played around with a few commercial ESL chatbots while doing resarch for this project, and to my surprise, none of them performed error correction. In addition, they mostly just respond to the user's input without asking follow-up questions to keep the conversation going. These are a couple of problems we will try to solve with the chatbots we build."

    "Now it is time to create the first chatbot. This bot is named \"Alan\" after Alan Turing. Both of the bots we create will make use of the Best Match logic adapter, which finds the statement in the training data that most closely resembles the input statement. In this case, the comparison will be made using the `SpacySimilarity` function, which employs `spaCy`, a popular NLP library, to measure the similarity of the strings. This is done by comparing word vectors, which are high-dimensional embeddings of words to capture their meanings. Using `spaCy`, two words like \"cat\" and \"feline\" would achieve a high similarity score, despite not sharing any letters. Once a match is made, there may be multiple possible responses, especially if the line appears more than once in the training data. For Alan, we will use the `get_random_response` function to make a random choice from the list of possible responses. The similarity threshold is set to 0.95, so two strings must be 95% similar to be considered a match. If no match is found, the bot will return a random question from the `question_list` we created above."

    "So Alan works pretty well, although not perfectly. The parameters used to create Alan are those that I believe will create the most effective chatbot. However, it might be interesting to creat a second chatbot using some different parameters, and then compare performance. The new chatbot will be named Alma. Instead of the `SpacySimilarity` function, the `LevenshteinDistance` function will be used. Levenshtein Distance is a measure of similarity between two strings based on the minimum number of edits (such as insertions or deletions) necessary to change one string into another.  Using this metric, the strings \"cat\" and \"cart\" have a high similarity score, despite having completely different meanings, where as \"cat\" and \"feline\" would have a very low score, despite the words being related. However, this metric might do a better job of capturing meaning found in the syntax of sentences. `SpacySimilarity` first transforms sentences into a bag of words, so the phrases \"the boy ate chicken\", and \"a chicken ate the boy\" would be very similar, despite having different meanings. In this case, Levenshtein Distance would do a better job at capturing the difference. For response selection, this new not will use the `get_most_frequent_response` function, making it a little more predictable the first one."

    "Alma also works pretty well, despite the fact that it (or she) makes use of different functions to compare the statements and select responses. Both of the bots stumble from time to time. Sometimes they give nonsensical responses, and the `GingerIt` parser sometimes misses grammatical errors or gives bad corrections. In general, however, they work pretty well, especially considering how simple they are. The last thing we will do is have the bots chat with each other little. Below is a conversation between Alan and Alma."
